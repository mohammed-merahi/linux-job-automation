# Linux Job Automation â€“ Study Notes

## Tools Covered
- `cron`: Recurring job scheduler
- `at`: One-time job scheduler
- Shell scripting: Automating tasks with logging

## Key Commands
- `crontab -e`
- `at 14:00`
- `tar -czf` for backups
- `date` for timestamps

## Reflections
This topic is foundational for sysadmins. I plan to expand this into:
- Monitoring cron jobs with email alerts
- Integrating with Oracle DB backups
- Scheduling Power BI data refreshes (via Windows Task Scheduler)

Stay tuned for more videos in my #HybridITJourney!
